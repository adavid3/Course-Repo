<H1> Homework Reading Assignments and Questions </H1>

<HR>

<P>Before each lecture, a reading list will be assigned and all
registered students should read the assigned material and email a list
of critical questions about the material to the instructor,
<em>before</em> the lecture.<BR />
Email your questions as <b>plain text</b>. Do <em>not</em> send attachments,
unless you need to attach an image or a diagram. Put a subject
line to your email, indicating what date the questions are for.
For example, "Reading assignment questions for 01/21/2011".<BR>
This is important to help me with finding your questions in my
mailbox at the end of the semester when I will do the grading.
</P>

</P>

<P>You should ask anything that you feel needs better explanation.  It
is impossible that you will find everything clear in the assigned
material and careful reading and thinking about the material will
surely lead to some doubts and questions.<BR>
Also, if a statement or diagram appears to be incorrect, or
conflicting with another statement or diagram&#151;that is also a
good question to ask.<BR>  Just ask about any doubt
that you encounter.
</P>

<P>Please do not send vague statements, which
are not even questions, such as these examples:<BR>

1. "I don't understand Example ___<em><u>x</u></em>____ fully."<BR>

2. "I understand the principles for assigning responsibilities, but I am confused about Figure 2-17?"<BR>

First, these are <em>not</em> questions. They are statements about
person's state of understanding.
Second, they are not at all specific about what is not clear.
It is not possible even to try to answer them and clarify the refereed
materials, because it could be anything.<BR>

Please be more specific in your questions.
In the above example, what exactly are you finding confusing
about Figure 2-17?<BR>

We will <em>not</em> consider such vague questions when grading your
reading assignments.
</P>

<P>A tyical mistake students do goes like this: <em>I did not submit
any reading assignments because most of the time I could either
comprehend things or I would research the Web to understand
them.</em><BR />
The purpose of the reading assignments is twofold: (1) for students to
master the course material and (2) for instructor to know that
students worked on the assignment. Therefore, if you don't submit any
reading assignments, then the instructor does <em>not</em> know
whether or not you did them.
</P>

<P>Even if you find your answer to your doubts on the Web, please
email the questions and where you found the answer (provide the
<em>exact</em> URL, not just top-level domain name).<BR />
Students who invest extra effort and offer answers to their own
questions by consulting other sources (e.g., search the Web or check
other books) will receive double credit.<BR>
In this case, the source should be credited, by citing the URL or book
name.
</P>

<P>Because questions represent a significant component of the <a
href="index.html#GRADING">grade</a>, the students are highly
encouraged to send in their questions on time.<BR> Because of high
volume, we cannot guarantee to answer each question individually, but
we guarantee to read all your emails and keep track of who is asking
questions and about the quality of their questions for grading
purposes.
</P>

<P>We may also select some interesting questions to post
(anonymized) on this webpage.

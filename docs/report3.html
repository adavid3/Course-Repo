<B> Report #3: SPECIFICATION & DESIGN -- Iteration 2(a) (<u>Revised and Collated</u>) --&nbsp; (<A
HREF="syllabus.html#DELIVERABLES">due date given here</A>)</B>
<HR>

<P> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You must return your
graded <b>report#1</b> and <b>report#2</b> to us when submiting
report#3.</FONT> This will allow us to compare the progress and
facilitate the grading process.</P>

<h3>1. Report Format</h3>

<P> This report collates Reports #1 & #2 into a single document.  This
report should be <b>self-contained</b> and contain <b>all</b> the
information that is relevant to your project.  It should be possible
to discard all previous reports and read this one alone to obtain all
the relevant information about the project.  The report should reflect
the revisions and additions since the previous reports were
submitted.</P>

<P> The report format should follow the formats of the previous two
reports.  The report must contain the following sections:
<ol>
<li> Cover Page and Individual Contributions Breakdown, as specified <A
HREF="projects.html#REPORTS"><b>here</b></A>.
<li>Table of Contents<BR> <FONT SIZE=-1>Make sure that the page
numbers listed here are correct</FONT></li>
<li> Summary of Changes<br> <FONT SIZE=-1>
 Provide an <b>itemized list of key revisions</b> since the previous
 two reports.  This includes key changes in <em>project
 objectives</em>, <em>use case descriptions</em>, and <em>system
 design</em> (e.g., interaction diagrams, class and package
 diagrams).</FONT>
 </li>

<li> Customer Statement of Requirements (as in <A
 HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A>, revised as needed) </li>

<li> Glossary of Terms (as in <A
 HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A>, revised as needed) </li>

<li> Functional Requirements Specification (as in <A
 HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A>, revised as needed) <BR>
 <FONT SIZE=-1> Elaborate only the <em>use cases</em> that will be
 <em>implemented</em> by the time of the <A HREF="demo2.html">final
 demo</A>. For the use cases that will <em>not</em> be implemented for
 the final demo, provide a casual description for each and indicate
 that these could be considered for future work. <BR>
 <em>System Sequence Diagrams</em> should be updated to incorporate
 the use cases that will be completed for the final demo.</FONT> </li>

<li> Nonfunctional Requirements (as in <A
 HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A>, revised as needed) </li>

<li> Effort Estimation using Use Case Points<BR>
 <FONT SIZE=-1>When calculating duration (equation 4.8 in the lecture
 notes), assume the productivity factor <em>PF</em> = 28 hours per use
 case point. &nbsp; Show the process, not only the final number.
 </FONT> </li>

<li> Domain Analysis (as in <A
 HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A>, revised to incorporate the use
 cases that will be completed for the final demo) </li>

<li> Interaction Diagrams (as in <A
 HREF="report2.html">Report #2</A>, revised as needed)
 <ul>
 <li> IMPORTANT: Your revised interaction diagrams must include some
 of the <font color="#ff0000"><b><em>Design Patterns</em></b></font>
 that were covered in the lectures after the Report #2 was submitted. <BR>
 <em>Explain and justify</em> the patterns that you use in your new
 design.  State explicitly in what sense the use of the specific
 design pattern in the particular interaction diagrams improves the
 design. </li>
 </ul> </li>

<li> Class Diagram and Interface Specification (as in <A
 HREF="report2.html">Report #2</A>, revised as needed) <BR>
 In addition, include the following subsections:
 <ol start=3 type="a">
 <li> Design Patterns<br> <FONT SIZE=-1>
   As for <em>Interaction Diagrams</em> indicate and
   discuss the use of <font color="#ff0000"><em>design
   patterns</em></font> to improve your design.</FONT> </li>
 <li> <font color="#ff0000">Object Constraint Language (OCL)
 Contracts</font> <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>
   List important contracts (invariants, preconditions,
   postconditions) for classes and their operations (See <em>Bruegge &
   Dutoit</em>, Chapter 9; and <em>Miles & Hamilton</em>, Appendix
   A)</FONT></li>
 </ol>

<li> System Architecture and System Design (as in <A
 HREF="report2.html">Report #2</A>, revised as needed) </li>

<li> Algorithms and Data Structures (as in <A
 HREF="report2.html">Report #2</A>, revised as needed) </li>

<li> User Interface Design and Implementation (as in <A
 HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A> <b>and</b> <A
 HREF="report2.html">Report #2</A>, revised to incorporate the use
 cases that will be completed for the final demo) </li>

<li> History of Work & Current Status of Implemenation <BR>
 <FONT SIZE=-1> Instead of the section <em>Plan of Work</em> have the
 section <font color="#ff0000"><em>History of Work</em></font> which
 documents how the actual milestones and deadlines evolved. Compare
 these against the milestones as planned in Reports #1 and #2.<BR>
 Also summarize (as a bulletted list) your key accomplishments in this
 project.</FONT>
</li>

<li> Conclusions and Future Work (minimum 2 pages) </li>
 <FONT SIZE=-1> <ul>
 <li> Describe the <em>technical challenges</em> you encountered in
 the development of your software product</li>
 <li> Describe how the software engineering techniques you learned in
 this course helped you to address those channelnges</li>
 <li> Describe what other knowledge you feel might have helped you
 with the project development</li>
 <li> Discuss possible directions for the future work on this
 project</li>
 </ul></FONT>
<li> References (books, papers, URL's of the sources of information and
tools used in the project) </li>
</ol>

<P> NOTE: Do <b>not</b> submit separately "revised/corrected" versions
of reports #1 and #2.  All corrections suggested for those reports
should be incorporated in report #3.  However, you must return the
graded versions of the previous two reports to compare.<BR> NOTE: If
in doubt of whether to include something from reports #1 and #2 since
it may be overlapping, then include everything that is <em>not</em>
repetitious.</P>

<P> Please include both the domain model and the class diagram in the
report. You should know by now that your domain model doesn't need to
exactly correspond to the class diagram.  In fact, it is very likely
that they'll be different, with class diagram having many more
classes.  Moreover, if they do match exactly, that is likely a sign of
a bad design.<BR> On the other hand, there should be significant
correlation between the two, since otherwise would imply that the
domain model was not used in the design (hence, it is completely
useless).</P>

<P> <em>Discuss your diagrams!</em> Describe all
design decisions and other things that are not obvious from
the diagrams.  Any useful information is welcome.  There is no
limit on the number of pages for the report.  Having good
comments and explanations greatly helps in reading and
evaluating the project and will certainly contribute
to your grade.<br>
Also, give exact references and URLs of any material that is used
in the project and doesn't originate from the textbook.</P>

<P>Since this report is a compilation and revision of the previous
two, it is a good idea to address all the issues that were not
adequately addressed in the first two reports.  Discuss with the TA
what could have been done better in the first two reports and also
take into account the comments that were provided to you earlier. <b>
Do not repeat the same mistakes. </b></P>


<h3>2. Grading</h3>

<P>See also the <A HREF="projects.html#GRADING">grading policy</A> for
the assigning the overall team grade vs. grades for the individual
members.</P>

<P> The reports will be graded approximately as follows:<BR>
(Please note that the grading policy is subject to change, based on
overall class performance.)</P>

<P> Notice the grading focus on the mutual correspondence between the
(domain, class, interaction, etc.) diagrams as well as quality of the
comments.  To avoid confusion, it is extremely important that the
names of concepts, classes, methods, and attributes are
<b>consistent</b> across all diagrams. </P>

<P>See <A HREF="report1.html#EXTRA_EFFORT">Report #1</A> for
explanation about the "Project Management" part of the grade. </P>

<H3>3. &nbsp; Report Submission</H3>

<P> Each team should submit only <em>one report</em> to the TA.  Bring
the report to the <A HREF="index.html#TA">TA's office</A> on or before
the due date. </P>

<P>Submission deadline: <B>5:00 p.m. on the due date</B>.

<p><strong>The project report materials will not be returned, so make

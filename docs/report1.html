This document is also known as <em>Requirements Analysis Document</em>
(RAD).

<P> <b>Note</b>: Keep this report for future reference since it will
become part of the final report (<A HREF="report3.html">Report
#3</A>).  Thus, as you progress through the semester, take every
opportunity to revise, update and/or correct it.</P>

<H3>1. &nbsp; Report Format</H3>

 should be much more detailed than for the April/May period.<BR>
 Preferably, you should use <a href="http://www.ganttchart.com/">Gantt
 charts</a> for planning and scheduling your project.
 (Rutgers students can download <em>Microsoft Project</em> at the <a
 href="https://software.rutgers.edu/">University Software Portal</a>.)<BR>
 Also provide the</FONT> breakdown of responsibilities<FONT SIZE=-1>:
 what each team member did so far, is currently doing, will do in the
 future.</FONT></li>
</li>
<li> References<BR> <FONT SIZE=-1>The list of references should
contain exact <em>references and URLs</em> of any material that is
used in the project and doesn&#146;t come from the textbook. Each
reference should be cited in the main text; otherwise, it should
<b>not</b> appear in the list of references.</FONT> </li>
</ol>

<P>A minimum 3-page <b>customer statement of requirements</b> is
required, see item #3 above. This should describe <i>informally,
without the use-case jargon</i>, motivation for your project, what
kind of problem you are solving, and how this problem is solved in the
current practice (before your proposed system gets deployed).  Use the
application domain language and terminology, i.e., the language
familiar to your target users, and avoid technical jargon.  Utilize
charts, illustrations, and screen mock-ups to make it easier for the
reader to understand the problem.  Provide references (books, papers,
websites) where to find more information or see existing solutions.
Examples are given in Section 1.5 of <A
HREF="../../books/SE/"><b>class lecture notes</b></A>.<BR>
Enumerate all the <b>requirements</b> at the end of this
section. Each requirement should briefly state what the user should
be able to do using the system or what the system should do
automatically, e.g., at periodic intervals.

<P>Also see Appendix A: <a href="report1-appA.html"><em>User Effort Estimation</em></a></P>

<P> <em>There is <b>no limit</b> on the number of pages for the
report.</em> Of course, you should avoid stuffing your report with
redundant or irrelevant material.  The report must be
<b>self-contained</b>; the grader should not need to read any other
material to read and understand the report.  You should provide as
much details as possible (particularly in the use case scenarios and
the domain model), but these are <em>business</em> details, i.e., how
the user typically interacts with the system to obtain the
service. You should <em>not</em> go into <em>software</em> details of
how you plan to build this system.
(The latter will be part of <A HREF="report2.html">Report #2</A>.)<BR>
Brevity is good because it will be easier for you to create a
professionally looking technical report&#151;it is easier to
<em>maintain consistency, clarity, and readability</em> for shorter
reports.

to reduce wordiness in your writing (TechRepublic)</a>&#151;when you
streamline your wording, your message becomes more powerful and clear.
</P>

<P> Do not just show the UML diagrams&#151;provide some
<b>narrative</b>!  Unfortunately, diagrams, particularly technical
diagrams, are rarely if ever self-explanatory.  You should document
the alternative solutions that you considered as well as the arguments
for the final choice.  Diagrams only represent your final solution,
but do not explain why you decided on this solutions and what
alternatives were considered.  Hence, <b>all</b> diagrams must be
accompanied with explanation and discussion of alternatives and
tradeoffs.  Anything that could lead to ambiguity or misunderstanding
on the reviewer&#146;s part, should be clearly explained.
Explanations should be written in prose and key arguments highlighted
in bullet points.  Use the terminology from the textbook and the
lecture notes&#151;this is important so to facilitate the report
grading and reassure the grader that you are studying the textbook and
you understand it.</P>

<P>
The phrase &#147;few-most-important-use-cases&#148; used above is not
meant to discourage you from documenting all the use cases in full
detail.  If you have enough time to do it all&#151;go for it!  But, be
carefull not to get overextended and end up not being able to meet the
deadline.  Remember, in the spirit of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile
methods</a>:
<B>Do the best you can in the time available and hand in your report
<em>on time</em>.</B></P>

<P>
The above list gives only the main required items for this project
report.  It is absolutely necessary that you read and understand the
relevant materials in the <A
HREF="../../books/SE/"><b>class lecture
notes</b></A> in order to be able to prepare a good project
report. Check also <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_analysis">Requirements
analysis @ Wikipedia</a>.<BR>
Also, <em>IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements
Specifications</em> contains (in the appendix) several sample outlines
for the description of specific requirements: <a

<A NAME="EFFORT">
<H3>2. &nbsp; Effort Breakdown</H3>
</A>

<p>All teams must include in their reports a table showing effort
breakdown.  This activity has two purposes:
<ol>
<li>Help team members distribute the project responsibilities
equitably</li>
<li>Help instructor grade individual contributions fairly</li>
</ol>

The effort-breakdown table format for this report is as
follows. Assume that the team has five members and, for the sake of
illustration, their individual responsibilities are agreed to be as
shown in this <b>responsibility matrix</b>:

<table border>
<tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="2">

</tr>
</table>

<b>Note:</b> You may wish to have additional rows in the
responsibility matrix for all sub-sections of Sections 5 and 7 of the
report.  This will give you more accurate view of responsibility
allocation.

<p>The values in each row must add up to 100 %.  The values in each
column will give us the responsibility levels for individual team
members, as follows.  If we multiply the percentages for individual
team members with total number of points, we will know how many points
each member can potentially earn. For instance, <em>Member 1</em> in
the above example can earn a maximum of:

<center>
0.7 &#215; 10 points + 0.5 &#215; 6 points + 1.0 &#215; 3 points + 1.0
&#215; 1 point = 14 points
</center>
By repeating the same calculation for all team members, we will obtain
the following chart of <b>responsibility allocation</b> across the
team:<br>
( <em>Member 2</em>: 1.0 &#215; 4 + 0.6 &#215; 37 = 26.2 points <br>
&nbsp; <em>Member 3</em>: 0.2 &#215; 10 + 0.1 &#215; 37 + 0.2 &#215;
25 = 10.7 points <br>
&nbsp; <em>Member 4</em>: 0.2 &#215; 6 + 0.1 &#215; 37 + 1.0 &#215; 6
+ 0.8 &#215; 25 = 30.9 points <br>
&nbsp; <em>Member 5</em>: 0.1 &#215; 10 + 0.3 &#215; 6 + 0.2 &#215; 37
+ 1.0 &#215; 8 = 18.2 points )

<center><img src="responsibilities.jpg" alt="responsibility allocation
chart"></center>

<p>From this chart, we can easily see that the responsibility
allocation in the example scenario is not well balanced across the
team members.  Ideally, all members should take on approximately
equal level of responsibility.  Hence, in the above scenario, Members 1
and 3 should take on greater responsibility levels and Members 2 and 4
should reduce their responsibility levels.</p>

<A NAME="PREPARATION">
<H3>3. &nbsp; Report Preparation</H3>
</A>

<P> The report should be prepared on computer (special negative points
for handwriting and hand-drawn figures).  Using a software tool is
<b>mandatory</b> for producing this report.  Hand-drawn diagrams are
not acceptable.  Read the supplementary textbook ( Miles & Hamilton:
<em>Learning UML 2.0</em> ) for details on UML notation.  Here are
some options for software tools that support UML design:

<ul>
<li>Omondo EclipseUML <A HREF="http://www.omondo.com/">
<code>http://www.omondo.com/</code></A> (Academic License available
for free)<BR> works with Eclipse <A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/">
<code>http://www.eclipse.org/</code></A><BR> Note: This tool is also
installed in EIT Lab (D-110) </li>

<li> ArgoUML <A HREF="http://argouml.tigris.org/">

</ul>

You can search the web and find some other tool as well.
<em>Microsoft Visio</em> also supports UML symbology.  (Rutgers
students can download <em>Visio</em> at the <a
href="https://software.rutgers.edu/">University Software Portal</a>.)
Any tool that supports UML symbology is acceptable.</P>


<H3>4. &nbsp; When To Start Coding</H3>

<p>You should start implementing at least some functions of your
system <b>immediately</b>.  This code will help you to better specify
and design your system.  You should not wait until after submitting
Report #2 to start with coding&#151;the <A HREF="demo1.html">first
demo</A> is not that far away!<BR>
Check about the <a href="projects.html#RESOURCES"><b>departmental
resources here</b></a>.

<p>A note about <em><b>mock up screens</b> for the user
interface</em>.<BR> Keep in mind that you do not need to program in a
programming language in order to start generating mock up screens for
your system.  The idea of mock up screens is that you generate them in
PowerPoint or another graphics editor, not in a programming
language. </P>

<p>However, <em>do not report about the pilot implementations in this
report.</em>  The first time we expect you to report about the
implementation is in the <A HREF="demo1.html">first demo</A>.

<A NAME="EXTRA_EFFORT">
<P> <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>
</A>
It is not enough only to meet the listed requirements to receive the
maximum grade. For example, having a perfect report for a trivial
project will result in a very low overall grade.  Thus, the overall
quality and functionality of the project is the key scaling factor for
all other aspects of the grade. </P>

<P> The &#147;<b>extra effort</b>&#148; part of the grade is hard to
quantify; it is essentially what you do more than the minimum required
above&#151;how far you go &#147;beyond the call of duty.&#148; It also
includes the general appearance of the report and the overall
impression about the envisioned product and your creativity and
current progress.  Some indications of how extra points will be
assigned are given in the <A HREF="report1_grading.pdf">actual grading
sheet</A>.  You should demonstrate extra effort to receive 100% the
total score for this report. </P>

<P> These are key ingredients of a successful report:
<ul>

<li> Your project should appear as sufficiently <b>ambitious</b> for a
semester of work by a team of soon-to-graduate engineering students.
It should not leave impression that this can be done by a single
person, or within a much shorter time.
<ul>
<li>Don&#146;t worry if you don&#146;t have many actors or many use
cases. The complexity of the project is judged <em>as a whole</em>,
not only by the number of actors and/or use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li></p>

<li> The report should demonstrate your <b>creativity, knowledge, and
skill</b> in identifying and solving technical problems.</li></p>

<li> <b>Consistency, clarity, and correctness</b> of the report are
critical.  The report must be <b>complete</b>, in the sense that it is
<em>self-contained</em> and the reader doesn&#146;t need other
materials to understand it. Anticipate what could be confusing to
reviewers and clarify every possible source of ambiguity or
inconsistency.  Make sure that <b>all team members carefully read the
entire report</b> and understand its contents completely and
clearly. </li></p>

<li> The report should have <b>professional appearance</b>; make sure
that it is neat, easy to read and understand, with clearly labeled
section headings, figure captions, pagination, and without gramatical
and typographical errors. Also, check that diagrams and images are
<em>readable when printed</em> (i.e., letters or symbols are not to
small and illegible).  If you are using colors in images and diagrams,
check that they are discernable when printed in
black-and-white/grayscale. Every figure/table must be referenced in
the text and properly described.

</ul></p>

<H3>6. &nbsp; Report Submission</H3>

<P> Each team should submit only <em>one report</em> to the TA.  Email
a <b>PDF document</b> of the report both to the instructor
<em>and</em> the <A HREF="index.html#TA">TA</A> on or before the due
date. Also, the report should be posted for download on your project
website. </P>

<P>Submission deadline: <B>5:00 p.m. on the <A

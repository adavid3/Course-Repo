<DD>Monday, Wednesday, Friday: <b>2</b> (9:00 a.m. - 9:50 a.m.) in <b>Solano 2004</b></DD>

<P><DT><B>Course Description:</B> </DT>

<DD> The key objective of this course is to learn <b>modular
design</b> of software and documenting the design using
<b>symbolic representations</b>, i.e., UML diagrams.  The course will
cover software life-cycle models and different phases of the software
development process. <BR>
 Object-oriented techniques are key to the course.  Since the ultimate
result of software engineering is a working software package, the
course will put a great emphasis on developing a demonstrable software
package.  However, this is <em>not</em> a programming course.<BR>
The key characteristic is having teams of five to seven students work
on developing complex software systems over a course of one
semester. The grading is competitive, with the highest rated project
receiving the highest grade and the others being rated relatively to
the highest one.<BR>
The issue of which programming language to use often arises, and here
is an interesting view: <a

programming languages were religions...</a> &nbsp (or try <a

<P>Observe that 50 % of the grade is individual-based (questions and
exams), and 50 % is team-based (project deliverables). Please check
the detailed <a href="projects.html#GRADING">project grading
policy</a>.

<P><b>Requests for grade review will be considered no later than
<em>four weeks</em> after notification of the grade.</b>

<P>NOTE 1: The exams are <em>open book</em>, meaning that the students
can have access to the textbook or any other paper-based
materials. <BR> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">No discussion is allowed among
the students during the exam.</FONT> Such students shall be asked to
leave the classroom.

<P>NOTE 2: The reading assignments will be announced in advance and
students should email their questions to the instructor
<em>before</em> the class.  Even if for some reason you cannot make it
to the class, email your questions anyway.</P>

The University policy states that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&#147;The student with LD is responsible&#146; for making arrangements for accommodations and support services with the LD Specialist and the instructor in a timely manner.    
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If the student fails to make arrangements <em>before</em> the
exams, we may not be able to accomodate the last-moment requests.</P>

<H3>1. &nbsp; Purpose and Method</H3>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">
<P>The purpose of the course project is to provide the students with the
knowledge of software engineering methodology and the skills to apply
it.  The particular project is not the goal in itself; rather, it
serves as a vehicle to apply your knowledge and to develop the skills. </P>

<P>Projects also introduce students to team work, which is a must for
large-scale software development.  It also emerges as a key
methodology for any- and every-scale software development, something
called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">extreme
programming</a>.  The world in the information age is such that people
are expected to work together for mutual benefit and toward a shared
goal. The challenge is to make possible group efforts that discern
contributions of each individual. </P>

<P>The project consists of <b>two iterations</b>, both focused around
the <em>same</em> software product.  The first iteration is
<em>exploratory</em> and represents the first attempt at developing the
proposed software product. The <A
HREF="#DELIVERABLES">deliverables</A> for the <b>first
iteration</b> are reports #1 and #2 and demo #1.  After these, the
instructor/TA will provide feedback and the students should reconsider
and possibly revise the project goals before going on to the second
iteration.  Keep in mind that it's perfectly acceptable to modify your
objective in the middle of the semester, once you learn more about the
project and have better understanding of what you can accomplish
within the semester timeframe. (Of course, you cannot switch to a
completely different project in the middle of the semester.)  <em>This
is why we have two (2) iterations, so that in the second iteration you
can perform the necessary adjustments, based on what you learned in
the first iteration.</em> The <A
HREF="#DELIVERABLES">deliverables</A> for the <b>second
iteration</b> are report #3 and demo #2. </P>
</DIV>

<A NAME="TEAMS">
<H3>2. &nbsp; Team Work and Project Management</H3>
</A>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">
<P>Each team consists of 4 to 6 students.  All students in a team work
on the same project.  <em>Team work is <b>required</b> since team work
is an integral part of large-scale software development.</em> Requests
for working alone or with a smaller team will be rejected&#151;every
team must have at least four (4) members.

<P>You should form a team by the <A
HREF="syllabus.html#DELIVERABLES">specified date</A> and <b>notify by
email</b> the instructor with the following: Team member names and email addresses
and Github user names.

Project information pages will be hosted on Github pages, we will discuss this
in class. The instructor will create the project groups and initial repos.

<p>All team members must take part in all project activities, although
responsibilities may be divided so that different members take lead in
different activities.  But, <b>no</b> activity should be done
exclusively by a single person.  While the volume of work of each
group member on each project component may not be equal, their
contribution to the overall project should equal out.

Here are some <i>suggestions</i> (none of this is required!) about team work:
<ul>
<li> Choose the team leader to serve as a focal point. Discuss
individual skills and strengths (algorithm design, coding, report
writing, etc.)
</li>
<li> Set the meeting agenda and time limits. Once the task
responsibilities are known, in the beginning of the meeting have each
student report about the progress on their task since the last
meeting.  If you're working on a project report, everyone should hand
out drafts of their section or show slides of their diagrams or screen
shots. Students are encouraged to confer frequently and work
together on solving the problem </li>
<li> Decide how will the team communicate, e.g., email, blog,
instant messanger, ... In addition, all tema members must use Github
to host source codee. As you make progress on your task, send drafts
to others and ask for comments/suggestions. Don't wait until you have
everything polished and finalized, but make them aware that this is a
draft and tell them when to expect the next version  </li>
<li> Make every effort to ensure that <em>all</em> team members feel
comfortable about other members' contributions; be open about
grievances. It's a good idea to be collegial and professional in your
communications and avoid conflicts </li>
<li> If in the days before a project deadline you are prevented
(travel, illness, ...) from attending the team meetings, immediately
notify all your team members and try to contribute to the best of your
abilities </li>
<li>If for whatever reason your contribution falls short of that of
other team members, negotiate to assume greater work share in the
subsequent deliverable(s)
<li> General policy: <b>If in doubt, communicate!</b> Redundancy is
OK. Every time you send an email related to the project, copy the
email to all team members.  Do not assume that they are not interested
in it or they know what you're talking about.  Acknowledge any
electronic communication specifically targeted to you </li>
</ul>

<P>The team meetings should be <em>structured</em> to involve:
<ul>
<li> Report on the progress since the last meeting </li>
<li> Discussion of tasks that need to be done; come up with specific
action items </li>
<li> A period of time to assign responsibilites, draft the parts
each person is responsible for, and ask questions to be sure you are
all on the correct path </li>
</ul>
Saying that "nobody asked me to do this or that, or, I did everything
that I was asked to do" is an <b>unacceptable excuse</b>. Each team
member should be <em>proactive</em> and not wait passively to be
assigned the responsibilities.  Do <em>not</em> ask others what should
be done; rather, take initiative and suggest what should be done to
make your project successfull. Take every opportunity to redistribute
and/or rotate the responsibilities, make your personal suggestions be
heard! Many times defining the problem and determining what needs to
be done is more difficult than actually doing it. Hence, problem
defining and task assignment must be contributed to by all team
members, rather than by the team leader alone.</P>
</DIV>

<h4> What is the role of a team leader?</h4>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">
<P> First, keep in mind that having a team leader is <b>optional</b>.
You should elect the team leader only if you believe this would
facilitate your group work.  Alternatively, you can appoint
individuals to coordinate meetings, deadlines, and track project
progress, and rotate these roles among the team members.</P>

<P> The role of a team leader should not be misunderstood.  The team
leader is expected to provide <em>organizational and logistical
support</em>, that is, to organize team meetings and keep track about
work progress.  The team leader is <b><em>not</em></b> expected to set
the objectives, partition the tasks, and devise solution strategies.
These responisbilities must be shared equitably by all team
members.</P>

<P>It is a good idea to select the team leader based on his or her
<em>leadership, organizational, and social skills</em>, rather than
their technical skills and knowledge.  Past experience has shown that
people with poor organizational/social skills turn out to be poor
leaders and their teams end up being disfunctional, regardless of
their technical knowledge.</P>

<P>There are <em>neither benefits nor responsibilities</em> for the
team leader. The leadership is a voluntary responsibility, just to
facilitate the team work: help organize the meetings and remind the
team members about commitments and deadlines.  The team leader will
<b>not</b> receive any rewards (e.g., higher grade) for serving in
this capacity.  The leader is also <b>not</b> accountable for
&#147;failing to lead&#148; and cannot be blamed for the lack of
communication skills or general lack of success of the team's project.
For example, the leader has no such responsibilities as "knowing what
needs to be done", assigning work loads (fairly or otherwise), or
distributing the responsibilities.  This must be agreed upon by
consensus.  Most importantly, <em>each team member must be
proactive</em>, rather than waiting to be assigned the duties by the
team leader or anybody else. <BR> Remember, <em>All team members are
<b>equally</b> responsible for <b>all</b> aspects of the
project.</em></P>
</DIV>

<h4>What if your team is not functioning well?</h4>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">
<P> If you notice that your team does not function well or the team
leader tries to misuse his or her role, and this could negatively
impact your project performance, you should make every effort to
discuss this with other team members.  If the &#147;problematic&#148;
team members (including the team leader) refuse to cooperate, you
should discuss your concerns with the instructor, the sooner the
better. <br> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Complaints about poor team
functioning expressed at the end of semester will be
<b>ignored</b>.</FONT></P>

<A NAME="CONTRIB">
<H3>3. &nbsp; Individual Contributions Breakdown</H3>
</A>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">
<p>Many students find team work difficult due to different personal
interests and working habits.  Therefore, each student should keep
track of his or her contributions to the project.  The exact
<b>breakdown of individual contributions</b> must be provided for
every project deliverable, so that individual grades can be fairly
assigned.

<P><b> The breakdown of individual contributions should be submitted:
<ul>
<li> In case of written reports, as the second page of the  <A
HREF="#REPORTS">report</A> &nbsp; <em>OR</em>
</li>
<li> In case of <A
HREF="#DEMOS">project demos</A>, by email to the instructor
<em>and</em> the TA immediately after the project
deliverable.</b> Either of these options is acceptable:
<ol type="a">
<li>One team member emails a single contributions breakdown for their
team (this is preferable, but please copy your colleagues on this
email), <b>or</b></li>
<li>Each student emails individually an itemized list of their own
contributions only.
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<P><b>Each student</b> should provide an <b>itemized list</b> of his
or her own contributions to the components of the particular
deliverable, such as: <BR>
 &nbsp; . requirements specification (use cases and non-functional requirements), <BR>
 &nbsp; . software design (whole system or list specific modules), <BR>
 &nbsp; . coding (whole system or list specific modules), <BR> &nbsp;
 . debugging (whole system or list specific modules), <BR> &nbsp;
 . report preparation (whole report or list specific sections/diagrams), <BR>
 &nbsp; . Other: any other relevant contribution. <BR>
If several students contributed to a particular component, <b>quantify, as
a percentage,</b> each student's contribution to this component.
Provide also a short description of your own contribution.

<P>Team members who are not listed in the joint breakdown or do not
email their contribution list will be considered as <b>not
contributed</b> to the deliverable in question and will be assigned
<b>zero credit</b> for this deliverable.

<P><b>Please keep in mind that you must inform us exactly of who did
what if you expect us to assign the grades fairly. <BR> There are <A
HREF="syllabus.html#DELIVERABLES">seven project deliverables</A>, so we need
seven (7) contribution breakdowns from you. </b>

<A NAME="PROPOSALS">
<H3>4. &nbsp; Project Proposals</H3>
</A>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">

<P>It does not really matter if the project was done before or it is
being done by another team as long as you will not copy their designs
and/or the code.  If you will come up with an original design and
implement your own code, it is perfectly fine that you develop a
product somebody else did earlier or is doing now.</P>

<P>NOTE: Unfortunately, the department is unable to provide resources
for special project needs.  Try to select the project and

<h4>Project Web Site and Web Log (Blog)</h4>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">
<P>Each team should maintain a single <b>web site</b> per team,

website is for the instructors to be able to track the project
progress.  All project material (progress reports, related web sites,
etc.) should be posted on this web site.  Important announcements
should be posted as well. <BR>  This site will be host on Github pages
in the project repository.</P>

<P>The team should also maintain their <b>blog</b> (an online journal
&#151;a freeform mix of news items, commentaries, and whatever else comes
to mind), describing the project-related activities. You can get a
free blog hosting on many sites on the Web. The blog should be linked
from the project's website.</P>

<H3>6. &nbsp; Report Format</H3>
</A>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">
<P>There are a total of three reports required for the semester.  For
all projects, the reports should be submitted by the whole team (one
report per team) and the report will be graded as a whole.


<P>Every report must have a <em>cover page</em> containing: <BR>
&nbsp; .  the course title, <BR> &nbsp; . group number, <BR> &nbsp;
. project title, <BR> &nbsp;
. URL of the project's website <BR>
 &nbsp; . submission date, and <BR> &nbsp; . all
team-member names. <BR> Negative points will be assigned to reports
missing- or having an incomplete cover page.

<P>The <b>second page</b> of each report must detail the <b>breakdown
of individual contributions</b> of each team member to the project
(use more pages if the breakdown does not fit in a single page).
<b>Each student</b> should provide an <b>itemized list</b> of his or her
own contributions to the components of the report, such as: <BR>
 &nbsp; . requirements specification (use cases and non-functional requirements), <BR>
 &nbsp; . software design (whole system or list specific modules), <BR>
 &nbsp; . coding (whole system or list specific modules), <BR> &nbsp;
 . debugging (whole system or list specific modules), <BR> &nbsp;
 . report preparation (whole report or list specific sections/diagrams), <BR>
 &nbsp; . Other: any other relevant contribution. <BR>
If several students contributed to a particular component, <b>quantify, as
a percentage,</b> each student's contribution this component. <BR>
If all members of the team feel that everyone contributed equally, you
can just write "<em>All team members contributed equally</em>" instead
of a detailed breakdown.<br>
The reports missing- or having an incomplete contributions breakdown
page will be <b>returned for revision</b> before grading.

<P>The rest of the report must follow the detailed descriptions given here:
<ol>
<li><A HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A></li>
<li><A HREF="report2.html">Report #2</A></li>
<li><A HREF="report3.html">Report #3</A></li>
</ol>

<P>Reports should be prepared using a word processor and printed on a
(preferably) laser printer.  Handwritten reports or reports which
contain handwritten material (e.g., figures, tables, etc.) will
<em>not</em> be accepted. It is easier for us if you turn in your
documents electronically in PDF format. Here is a <a
href="http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp">PDF
writer</a> you can use from Windows. Macs automatically convert
postscript to PDF by clicking on the file icon. There are UNIX
utilities that convert postscript to PDF for Linux users; make sure
you include all fonts in the created PDF.

<P>Students are highly encouraged to use a software tool to
prepare the UML diagrams for the reports. I will be using ArgoUML in class.
However, <em>any tool that supports creating UML diagrams is acceptable.</em>

<A NAME="DEMOS">
<H3>7. &nbsp; Project Demos</H3>
</A>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">
<P>The purpose of project demos is to complement the written project
reports.  Keep in mind that the purpose of the course project is to
provide you with the knowledge of software engineering methodology and
the skills to apply it.  The particular project is not the goal in
itself; rather, it serves as a vehicle to apply your knowledge and to
develop the skills.  Thus, the demo presentation (as well as the
written reports) should demonstrate your <em>understanding</em> of the
software development process, rather than just give a dull description
of the current status of your project. See more on the <A
HREF="demo1.html">demo format here</A>.<P>

<P> Each team will give <em>two demo presentations</em>, each lasting
about <b>15 min</b>.  The demos will take place TBD.
If you're using your own laptop/notebook to project the slides and run
your software, please ensure that the video connector is compatible
with the cables in the lab <b>before the actual demo</b>.<P>

<A NAME="GRADING">
<H3>8. &nbsp; Project Grading Policy</H3>
</A>

<DIV align="justify" style="width: 675;">

<P>The grading policy for individual deliverables will be posted
in the respective description of that deliverable.  The specific
requirements to be met will be listed.
The reports will be graded based upon the technical content and the
clarity of the exposition.
<br> However, it is <B>not</B>
enough to meet all the listed requirements to receive the maximum
grade. For example, having a perfect report for a trivial project will
result in a very low overall grade.  Thus, the overall quality and
functionality of the project is the key scaling factor for all other
aspects of the grade.<P>

<P>Each student must be aware that a major part of his or her final
grade depends on the team project.  The failure to cooperate with
other team members and invest equitable amount of effort can lead to
undesirable outcomes.  To help us assign the grades fairly, you are
required to exactly specify the individual contributions to the
project (as described <A HREF="#CONTRIB">above</A>).<P>

<P>Grading the project-related deliverables works as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Each deliverable is graded as a whole and the grade is
assigned, <i>relative</i> to the quality of deliverables submitted by
other teams.
</LI>
<LI> Next, the total grade is divided among the individual team
members, based on the reported contributions breakdown and the judged
quality of these contributions.
</OL>
Hence, it is quite possible that members of the same team receive
different grades.

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Late reports</FONT> will be levied a late
penalty of 10% per day, up to 3 days late.  After that, no credit will
be given, unless <b>more than 40 % of team members</b> (e.g., at least
3 out of 5) provide a written excuse from a physician.  Since the
deadlines are known well ahead, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><b>there will be
no extensions for any of the deadlines. Please don't bother
asking.</B></FONT>

<P><b>Contact the instructor immediately should you have any questions
or concerns about the grading policy.</b> <BR> <BR>

<H3>1. &nbsp; How to Write a Software Project Proposal</H3>

To write and submit a project proposal, please follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI> Read carefully the project ideas described in the <A
HREF="../../books/SE/"><b>class lecture
notes</b></A> in <b>Section 1.5</b>, starting on page 38.<BR>
<a href="../../books/SE/projects/">Complete information on these
software engineering project ideas is available here</a>.
</LI></P>

<LI> If you like one of the project ideas
described therein, go to <b>Section 3</b>: <A HREF="#PROCESS">Proposal
Format, Submission, and Feedback</A>.
</LI></P>

<LI> If you would rather come up with your own idea for a project, go
to <b>Section 2</b>: <A HREF="#NEW-IDEAS">Proposing Your Own
Idea for a Project</A>.
</LI>
</OL></P>

<A NAME="NEW-IDEAS">
<H3>2. &nbsp; Proposing Your Own Idea for a Software Project</H3>
</A>

<P>Read this section only if you prefer to work on a project based on
your own idea. Conversely, if you decided to work on one of the
<a href="../../books/SE/projects/">example software project ideas</A>,
you can skip this section and go immediately to
<b>Section 3</b>: <A HREF="#PROCESS">Proposal Format, Submission, and
Feedback</A>.</P>

<P>When thinking about a new project, please keep in mind that the
project must be <b>equivalent in terms of difficulty</b> to the
<a href="../../books/SE/projects/">example software projects</A>.<BR>
This requires a major effort and you may not be able to accomplish it within the short period during which the work on project should commence.<BR>
Therefore, students are discouraged from proposing their own projects. Only highly motivated and knowledgeable teams should consider proposing their own projects.
</P>

<DL>

<DT><B>Required Project Components</B></DT>

<DD>
The goal of the project is develop software for an online service --
for example, an online auction, online book/music/video store, online
backup service, online collaboration service, etc. (use your
imagination). Key components that the project must include are:
<ol>
<li> <b>Data Input</b> <BR>
<font size=-1>Mechanism of input, manual or read a dataset from a
file, or from a web site (via <a
href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html">RSS</a> feeds)</font> </li>
<li> <b>Archiving</b> <BR>
<font size=-1>Examples include: SQL database (e.g., mySQL), flat file,
or an online data storage (search the Web)</font> </li>
<li> <b>Analysis</b> <BR>
<font size=-1>Such as data search (discovering specific
services/products among those available), sorting, regression
analysis, other statistical analysis, etc. (see more about this
below)</font> </li>
<li> <b>Display</b> <BR>
<font size=-1>Visualization of the analysis results using graphs and
charts</font> </li>
</ol>
Other important characteristics:
<ul>
<li>The system must be <b>accessible over the Web</b>, using a web
browser or a specialized application client.</li>
<li> It must also include a <b>security and access control
mechanism</b> that takes into account the different types/roles of
users (customer, system administrator, etc.).</li>
<li>Support for <b>managing users and maintaining user state</b>
(e.g. profiles). Security will play a role here as well. </li>
<li> <b>Online help capability and error reporting/tracking
capability</b>.</li>
</ul>
</P>
 </DD>

<DT><B>Project Must Include Programming</B></DT>

<DD>
<P>When deciding about the project, the most important thing to keep
in mind is that the software product you will develop should require
lot of programming. This is a <em>design</em> rather than a
<em>programming</em> course. However, in order to learn good design,
the process must include actual implementation of the design.
Therefore, the project <b><em>must include programming</em></b>.

<P> For example, creating a data-bank and <em><b>processing</b></em>
this data is a programming task.  If your system just allows the user
to set or modify values of different database records, that is
<b>not</b> data processing.  Examples of programming (data processing)
include, data-bank re-organization, keyword-based search and
retrieval, filtering and summarization of the data-bank, selecting a
small group of users for notification, etc.  However, just saying:
<em>The system will provide search facilities</em>, may mean that you
are using SQL database calls and doing <b>no programming at all</b>.
And, programming is done in a programming language, such as C, C++,
Java, or C#.

<P><B>Note: Designing web pages <em>passive</em> web pages which
contain <em>only</em> HTML is <em>not</em> programming.</B> Therefore,
your project <em>can</em> include web page design, but that is not
enough.<BR>
On the other hand, designing active webpages using AJAX, Flash, etc.,
is programming and is perfectly acceptable for the class
project.</P>

<P> Focus more on <b>automatic</b> data processing: not what user
can manually do, but what system does automatically to save the
user's effort.  For example, suppose you are designing a system for
online purchasing of airline tickets.  You could incorporate the
following data processing features:
<ul>
<li> When user queries for the available flights, sort the results by
price or some other attribute before displaying them;
<li> Allow pending reservation requests for a price below a certain
threshold, or in case another passenger cancels a completely booked
flight;
<li> Design a feature for marketing to the users based on their travel
history;
<li> If the flight gets delayed or cancelled, the system should
automatically send notification to the passengers;
</ul>
Strive to reduce the user's manual interaction with the system and
increase the system "smarts"!  Let the system do the work for the
user!  Nobody is impressed with a system where the user has to invest
hard work to get even simple tasks accomplished.<em> Make every effort
to reduce the number of clicks and keystrokes necessary for task
completion.</em></P>

<P> Keep in mind that the key purpose of this course is that you learn
how to do <b>modular design</b> of software and how to document the
design using <b>symbolic representations</b>, i.e., UML
diagrams. Thus, you should <em>avoid flashy user interfaces and
proprietary software</em>.
These will definitely not contribute positively to your grade, and may
have negative effects. Limit your software to the tools commonly and
<em>freely</em> available on the Web. </P>

<P> It is a good idea to review the <A HREF="demo1.html">first
demo</A> and <A HREF="demo2.html">second demo</A> descriptions to see
how your project will be graded.</P>
 </DD>


<DT><B>Choice of the Topic</B></DT>

<DD>
<P>The proposed topic can be almost anything; however, it is advisable
to come up with something novel and innovative to keep you interested
in its realization, and because innovativeness tends to make
impression on the reviewers.

<P>You could get an idea for interesting service(s) by exploring these
web-sites:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF="https://joindiaspora.com/">
<code>https://joindiaspora.com/</code></A> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <A HREF="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Diaspora">Installing and Running Diaspora</A></li>
<li> <A HREF="http://developers.facebook.com/">
<code>http://developers.facebook.com/</code></A> </li>
</ul>
Your project may or may not be Web based, but it must include
programming.

<P>The process of casting out the right-size project for a given
period of performance can be very frustrating.  You cannot ever know
what you'll encounter while working on it.  I believe that it's better
to start more ambitious and later scale down, if necessary.  Start
with an initial idea of desirable services and discuss as much details
as possible with your partners to figure out whether or not you as a
team can develop it in the given time frame.  Of course, you'll have
chance to adjust your goals during the semester, as you learn more
details about your target product. </P>

<A NAME="PROCESS">
<H3>3. &nbsp; Proposal Format, Submission, and Feedback</H3>
</A>

<DT><B>Proposal Format</B></DT>

<DL>

<DD>
Each proposal should contain the following:

<OL>
<LI>Project title, Group number</LI>
<LI>URL of the project web-site</LI>
<LI>Team profile:
 <ol TYPE="a">
 <li> Individual qualifications and strengths (such as: programming,
 design, presentation, documentation, management and organization)
 <BR>
Note: It is expected that every team member shall be involved in all
project activities; this only indicates individual strengths, not
their sole responsibilities
 <li> Name of the elected team leader, if any (having a team leader is
 <b>optional</b>) <BR>
The team leader should act as facilitator, to organize group meetings
and generally keep track of project activities (check here details
about the <A HREF="projects.html#TEAMS">role of team leaders</A>)
 </ol></LI>
<LI>Proposed project description</LI>
 <ol TYPE="a">
 <li>If you are proposing one of the projects described in class
 lecture notes, write down the project name and describe briefly if
 you plan to modify the project in any way, relative to the original
 description.<BR>
 <b><u>STOP HERE AND SUBMIT THE PROPOSAL AS DESCRIBED BELOW</u></b></li></P>
 <li>If you are proposing your own idea for a project, your project
 description must be equivalent in the level of detail to the project
 descriptions provided in  the <a href="../../books/SE/projects/">example software projects</A>.<BR>
 Make sure to include the following:
 <ol TYPE="i">
<LI>Statement of the goal</LI>
<LI>List of the services to be provided by the proposed system
(describe each service very briefly) <BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">For every feature, state whether you will write the
programs to support it, or you will use existing programs.<BR>
For example, if you state:  <em>The system will provide search
facilities</em>, will you write the program to perform the search, or
you plan to use existing software?</FONT></LI>
<LI>Description of the <b>programming</b> part of your project<BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">Explain what kind of data processing/analysis you will
do. Tell us exactly why we should consider your project as
programming. Just saying: <em>The system will provide search
facilities</em>, may mean that you are using SQL database calls and
doing no programming at all. </FONT>
<LI>Description of the typical system customers</LI>
<LI>Mention also if you already have a customer
(somebody interested in the end product that you will develop)</LI>
 </ol>
 </ol>
</OL>
<P> In case of novel project proposals (not based on the
projects described in the class lecture notes), make sure that it is
obvious to the reviewer that the proposed project includes
programming.  Note that Item 4.<em>b</em>.<em>ii</em> (list of the
services) is <em>not</em> use cases; do not show those as a use case
diagram. Rather, describe what value they offer to the customer.  In
general, avoid technical details of <em>how</em> you plan to develop it;
rather, focus on <em>what</em> you're planning to develop.  The
proposal is more of a marketing document, and less of a technical
document.  However, it must be clear from the proposal what value is
in your proposed project for the potential customers.

<P> The document should be prepared on computer (special negative
points for handwriting and hand-drawn figures). </P>

</DD>

<DT><B>Proposal Submission</B></DT>

<DD>
<P>Because the project is a team work, each team submits a
<em>single document</em> for the entire team.  Email a <b>PDF document</b> of your proposal to both the instructor and the <A HREF="index.html#TA">TA</A> on or before
the <A
HREF="syllabus.html#DELIVERABLES">due date given here</A>. <BR>
Submission deadline: <b>5:00 p.m. on the due date</b>. <BR>
Here is a <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp">PDF
writer</a> you can use from Windows. Macs automatically convert
postscript to PDF by clicking on the file icon. There are UNIX
utilities that convert postscript to PDF for Linux users; make sure
you include all fonts in the created PDF.
</P>

<P> In case of novel project proposals (not based on the
projects described in the class lecture notes), email immediately the
<a href="projects.html#TEAMS">breakdown</a> of the individual
contributions to the proposal. </P>

</DD>


<DT><B>Feedback</B></DT>

<DD>
<P>We will provide written feedback <b>only for novel project
proposals</b> via email in case we feel the proposal should be
revised. No feedback will be provided for proposals based on the
projects described in the <A
HREF="../../books/SE/">class lecture notes</A>.  The
only two reasons for revision could be:
<ul>
<li> Project does not appear to include programming </li>
<li> Project does not appear to be sufficiently ambitious </li>
</ul></P>
<P>The students are encouraged to be <b>ambitious</b> in the first
iteration of the project.  You will have chance to revise your project
objectives at the end of the first iteration, by the time of <a
href="demo1.html">Demo #1</a>. At that time, you must be
<b>realistic</b> and you may have decide that you need to scale down
the project scope, so to be able to finish it by the end of the
semester. <BR> <BR>

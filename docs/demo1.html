<B> Demo #1 -- Iteration 1(c) --&nbsp; (<A
HREF="syllabus.html#DELIVERABLES">date listed here</A>)
</B><HR>
<P>

<P> This demo should show your interim accomplishments.
The main criteria in grading the demo will be the <b>complexity and
quality</b> of the software product.  It should implement non-trivial
behavior and run without or with minimum crashing. </P>

<P><b>After this demo, you should <font color="#ff0000">pause and
reconsider</font> your project objectives.</b> Do you believe that you
can accomplish all the goals you set out to accomplish by the end of
the semester? Are you falling behind the schedule? Should you scale
down the project? Should you simplify or entirely remove some use
cases?  Conversely, if you feel that things are going smoothly,
perhaps you should expand the system features?  Perhaps your project
currently is not ambitious enough?</P>

<H3>1. &nbsp; Product Brochure</H3>

<P>Each team should bring to the demo a one-to-two-pages advertising
leaflet providing basic descriptive information about the software
product they developed.  No more than two (2) pages are allowed!  At
the least, the brochure should include the group number and
members&#146; names, project title, project webpage URL, the list of
features and short description of each feature, system requirements to
run the system, etc.  A block diagram of the system and some screen
snapshots could be useful, too.  Please keep in mind that this
is a marketing brochure, not a technical document.
</P>

<H3>2. &nbsp; Demo Format</H3>

<p>The key part of the demo should be spent in demoing the software
product.  Do not waste too much time on non-essential features of your
product, such as login, user authentication, and creating new user
accounts (we see this all the time and it&#146;s boring to see it
anew).  Create some user accounts before the demo, so you can use the
existing accounts to demonstrate the system functionality.  Explaining
how login works is like advertising that a car has a steering wheel.
Of course steering wheel is critical, but what kind of a car is that
if you need to advertise this fact and state the obvious?!  Your most
important concern should be to show the <b>essential and unique
functions</b> of your product, not those that are assumed by
default. </P>

<P>The demo format is as follows:
<ol>
<li> Use up to five (5) <em>slides</em> to give a short overview of
 the product&#151;who and what it is for</li>
<li> Use <em>live demonstration</em> to show the features/functions
that you implemented so far:
 <ol type="a">
 <li> Briefly describe what the function does</li>
 <li> Demonstrate a scenario of how the user uses it</li>
 <li> During the demonstration, highlight important aspects, such as
 user interface design, any data processing at the application&#146;s
 back-end, etc. </li>
 </ol></li>
<li> Briefly outline your plan for the rest of the semester&#151;what
new features are you planning to have ready by the final demo. Use one
(1) slide only.</li>
</ol>

<P>Please keep in mind that this should be a <b>technical
demonstration</b>, not a marketing pitch.  If your application uses a
database, prepare several example records <em>before</em> the actual
demo, so you can focus on essential features during the demo. We
don&#146;t want to see how you create another user profile or manage
user accounts.<BR />
Likewise, if your system offers different services to different user
types, create profiles for different user types <em>before</em> the
actual demo. During the demo, focus on the services offered to these
users.</P>

<p>You want to impress the audience that:
<ul>
<li> You are addressing an <em>important problem</em> </li>
<li> The problem presents <em>technical challenges</em>, which you are
successfully tackling </li>
<li> Your solution employes <em>sophisticated software engineering
techniques</em> </li>
<li> This product will be easy to understand and operate/use </li>
</ul>

<P>Plan well in advance, so you can avoid disaster scenarios:
<ul>
<li> You&#146;re programming the night before the demo and a team
member accidentaly overwrites the latest code with an old
version. </li>
<li> Everything is running fine on your home computer, but you never
tried it on the ECE server, so the demo fails. </li>
<li> A key team member, the only one who knows how a particular module
works, cannot make it to the demo so the others are stuck.  Every
team member must be familiar with the system so to be able to conduct
the demo on their own (and to answer questions).
</ul>
</P>

<H3>3. &nbsp; Demo Schedule</H3>

<P><b>The Demo Room is at D-110 ( <a
href="http://ecs.rutgers.edu/eitlab/">EIT lab</a> ), Engineering
Building D-Wing.</b> &nbsp; (<a
href="http://ecs.rutgers.edu/eitsched.php">EIT reservation
schedule</a>)<BR /> We will have a very large touch screen for the
demo purpose. However, we do not want anyone to touch the screen with
dirty hands. We should avoid any contamination to the screen.  Please
<em>wash</em> your hands before you enter the computer lab at
D110. Any food or drink is strictly forbidden in this lab.  We also
have a huge projection screen which can show your work to
everybody. The operating systems are Windows and Linux. (Check details
about the available software on the <a
href="http://ecs.rutgers.edu/eitlab/">EIT lab home page</a>.)</P>

<P> Students are required to test their demos <b>before the actual
demo</b>.  In the past there were issues with software versions.  You
can bring your own laptop but contact the TA to arrange about network
connections. An alternative is to bring your own laptop/notebook and
connect to the projectors. If you&#146;re using your own laptop to
project the slides and run your software, please ensure that the video
connector is compatible with the cables in the lab <b>before the
actual demo</b>.</P>

<P>If you have preferences for the demo slot, please email the TA ASAP
requesting a time slot for you to give the demo (the slots will be
assigned on a first come first served basis).  Otherwise we will
assign you randomly to one of the remaining slots.  When contacting
the TA, put the request title in the subject line and indicate the
group number for which the reservation is being made so to speed up
the work. <BR />

<A
HREF="http://www.caip.rutgers.edu/~parlak/Teaching.html">
This table shows the current demo reservation schedule.</A>

<P> The demo should last <b>no more than 18 minutes</b>.  Make sure
your demo is ready <b>before it starts</b>; as you can see, the
schedule is tight and we&#146;ll not be able to wait until you get
ready.  See the TA <b>before</b> the demo if you need help with
installing and trying it on the lab machines. </P>

<P> NOTE: It is <b>required</b> that all group members be present for
the demo and each member takes part.  Although you are not required to
attend other groups&#146; demos, it is a good idea that you do so to
see how other students present their work and to compare your progress
with that of others. </P>

<H3>4. &nbsp; Grading</H3>

<P>Make sure to email us the  <A
HREF="projects.html#CONTRIB">breakdown of individual contributions</A>
immediately after the demo.

<P>See also the <A HREF="projects.html#GRADING">grading policy</A> for
the assigning the overall team grade vs. grades for the individual
members.

<P> The demo will be graded as follows:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><TD><CENTER>Aspect</CENTER></TD> <TD>Points</TD>
<TD><CENTER>Explanation</CENTER></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Functionality / <br /> Task complexity</TD><TD> 15 </TD>
<TD>
Emphasize the key functions of your system, what are they useful for. <br />
Show that this is a <em>non-trivial project</em> that required a team
of smart <br /> students working for a full semester. (Functions such as
<em>login</em> and <br /> <em>user registration</em> are not very interesting.)
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Programming, <b>not</b> <br /> webpage design</TD><TD> 15 </TD>
<TD>
You must convince us that <em>programming</em> has been
<em>central</em> for your <br /> project development and webpage design
has only been <em>ancillary</em>. <br /> In addition to regular
programming languages (C, C++, Java, C#), <br /> programming includes
dynamic websites and webpages using <br /> PHP, JSP, JavaScript, AJAX,
etc.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Software<br /> reliability</TD><TD> 10 </TD>
<TD>
&#147;Software reliability&#148; means that your software runs without
crashing <br /> and, generally, it does not display unintended
behavior or bugs.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Presentation<br /> quality</TD><TD> 10 </TD>
<TD>
Impress the audience that you have developed a useful, non-trivial
product, <br /> that only a highly trained software engineer can do.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>User Interface / <br /> Ease of use</TD><TD> 10 </TD>
<TD>
&#147;Ease-of-use of the user interface&#148; should not be confused
with a flashy <br /> interface.  On the contrary, you should avoid flashy
user interfaces.  <br /> &#147;Ease-of-use&#148; means that interface
is easy to understand and operate and<br /> allows the user to accomplish
the task with a minimum effort (see here<br /> about <a
href="report1-appA.html">estimating user effort</a>).  <br /> A
minimal user interface that is well organized should be sufficient.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Novelty/ <br /> Usefulness</TD><TD> 10 </TD>
<TD>
Demonstrate that you have invented at least something, some part <br /> of
your product, rather than plainly copying an existing idea. <br />
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Product <br /> brochure</TD><TD> 5 </TD>
<TD>
Informativeness and general appearance of the product brochure.
</TR>
<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF">Total<br /> points</TD><TD COLSPAN="2">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 75 </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>NOTE: Please keep in mind that the grades are assigned
<em>competitively</em>, i.e., the group that is perceived as the best
receives 100 % and the others are scaled relatively to this.

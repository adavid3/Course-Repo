<HR>

<h3>1. The e-Archive Format</h3>

Each group should submit an <u>electronic medium</u> (no printouts
accepted!) containing everything that is necessary to evaluate and run
your software.  You can either bring a physical medium, such as CD-ROM
or DVD disk, or post your ZIP file on your website and let us know
where to download it.  The required contents are as follows:
<ol>
<li> <code>"README.txt"</code> file containing all file names and for
     each file a brief description about the content of the file
<li> <strong>PDF</strong> files containing the entire <A
     HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A> and <A
     HREF="report2.html">Report #2</A> as these were <em>originally
     sumbitted</em>, <b>not</b> as modified as part of Report #3.
<li> Microsoft PowerPoint file containing any <b>slides</b> you used
     for your <A HREF="demo1.html">first demo</A> and those used for
     the <A HREF="demo2.html">final demo</A>.
<li> <strong>PDF</strong> file containing the entire <A
     HREF="report3.html">Report #3</A> as in the printed version
     submitted earlier.  The report should appear as a <b>single
     file</b>. All UML diagrams that appear in the printed version of
     Report #3 should be included in the electronic form.
<li> Complete project source code (Java files, or other programming or
     markup language, if such is used)
<li> Images or button icons loaded by the program when run
<li> Shell-scripts, CGI scripts, HTML files, and any and all other
     files needed to run the program
<li> Database tables and files or plain files containing example data
     to run the program
<li> Anything else that your program requires to be run? <br>
     (<font size=-1>Do not include publicly available or commercial
     software such as Java JDK packages or database software. We
     should not need special commercial software to run your
     software. </font>)
</ol>

Please store different information into different directories/folders.
For example, your directory tree may look like this
(<code>"README"</code> file is in the root folder):
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLPADDING=10 COLS=1 >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
    -
    |
    +-----> doc           // documentation plus Report #3, presentation slides, etc.
    |
    +-----> design        // UML diagrams
    |
    +--+--> code          // project code
       |
       +-------> java     // Java source code
       |
       +-------> classes  // compiled Java classes
       |
       +-------> images   // images and button icons
       |
       +-------> data     // (database) files with example data
       |
       +-------> run      // scripts and/or HTML files
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> Each source code file should have at the top information about
the student who authored it or assisted in writing and debugging
the code, something like:<br>
<pre>
  // written by:
  // assisted by:
  // debugged by:
  // etc.
</pre>
The code will be compared with the diagrams in Report #3.  The class,
attribute and method names should exactly match.  It is not necessary
that these are consistent with Reports #1 & #2 since Report #3 revises
and overrides the previous two.  However, it is critical that the
final UML diagrams in Report #3 and the final code are consistent.

<H3>2. Software Coding Standards</H3>

The source code should be neat and well documented.  This is in your
best interest so that all group members can seamlessly collaborate on
the project.  Please refer to the following web site for Java coding
standards guide: <A
HREF="http://developer.netscape.com:80/docs/technote/java/codestyle.html">
<tt>http://developer.netscape.com:80/docs/technote/java/codestyle.html</tt></A>


<p>Another set of coding standards is given here:
<A HREF="http://www.ambysoft.com/javaCodingStandards.html">
<tt>http://www.ambysoft.com/javaCodingStandards.html</tt></A>

<p>A major factor in grading will be how well the code corresponds to
the UML diagrams.  The class names, operation names, and attribute
names should exactly match. Put emphasis on consistency, neatness, and
completeness.  For example, all exceptions should be properly handled.
Do not just catch an exception with empty braces:
<code>catch(Exception ex) { }</code>.

documentation and source code can be found here: <A

<h3>3. Grading</h3>

<P>Note that only <b>negative points</b> will be given if the
eArchive/EPA is missing or poorly prepared.  <FONT
COLOR="#ff0000"><b>The project e-Archive can reduce the overall grade
by 10 % if missing or poorly prepared.</b></FONT> Email us the <A
HREF="projects.html#CONTRIB">breakdown of individual contributions</A>
immediately after submitting the eArchive.</P>

<P>See also the <A HREF="projects.html#GRADING">grading policy</A> for
the assigning the overall team grade vs. grades for the individual
members.</P>

<P>If submitting a physical medium, please make sure that the
electronic media (CD-ROM or Zip disk or ...) is
<b>not damaged</b> and can be read on a regular PC.</P>

<P> The eArchives will be graded as follows:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TD
BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><CENTER>Aspect</CENTER></TD><TD BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF">Points</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>
(1) Electronic version of any of the reports missing</TD><TD> <B>-3</B></TD>

(4) Poor quality of code documentation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a) Lack of correspondence between diagrams and code<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b) Poor code structure and readability<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c) Incomplete source code (e.g., missing files)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d) Missing information about the student who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; authored/assisted/debugged on top of each file </TD><TD> <B>-4</B> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; </TD>

<TR><TD>
(5) Inconsistency between the report printout and archive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;checked in terms of module/class/attribute/operation
names</TD><TD> <B>-1</B></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P> Notice the grading focus on the correspondence between the diagrams
and the quality of comments.

<H3>4. &nbsp; e-Archive Submission</H3>

<P> If submitting a physical medium, each team should submit only
<em>one e-Archive</em> to the TA.  Bring the e-Archive to the <A
HREF="index.html#TA">TA's office</A> on or before the due date.  If
you posted the ZIP file online, email us where to find it. Make sure
to email us the <A HREF="projects.html#CONTRIB">breakdown of
individual contributions</A> immediately after submitting the
eArchive. </P>

<P>Submission deadline: <B>5:00 p.m. on the due date</B>.

<p><strong>The project report materials will not be returned, so make
sure to keep your own copy of the e-Archive.</strong>

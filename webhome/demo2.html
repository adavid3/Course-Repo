<B> Demo #2 -- Iteration 2(b) --&nbsp; (<A
HREF="syllabus.html#DELIVERABLES">date listed here</A>)
</B>
<HR>
<P>

<P> This demo should show your accomplishments for the entire course.
The structure and grading criteria for the demo are the same as for
the <A HREF="demo1.html">demo #1</A>. </P>

<H3>1. &nbsp; Product Brochure</H3>

<P>Each team should bring to the demo a one-to-two-pages advertising
leaflet providing basic descriptive information about the software
product they developed.  No more than two (2) pages are allowed!  At
the least the brochure should include the group number and members'
names, project title, project webpage URL, the list of features and
short description of each feature, system requirements to run the
system, etc. Please keep in mind that this is a marketing brochure,
not a technical document.

<H3>2. &nbsp; Demo Format</H3>

<p>You should demonstrate the functional features of your software
product.  Please avoid demonstrating login, user authentication, and
creating new user accounts.  Focus on highlighting your achievements
<em>after</em> the first demo.  Of course, you need to demonstrate the
functions in context, but put emphasis on your new accomplishments
(after the first demo).
</P>

<P>The demo format is as follows:
<ol>
<li> Give a short verbal overview of the product -- who and what
 is it for <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Please avoid slide presentation in demo #2.  Rather, use
live demonstration to show the product functionality.</FONT></li>
<li> Highlight one, two, or three key features/functions:
 <ol type="a">
 <li> Briefly describe what the function does</li>
 <li> Demonstrate how the user uses it</li>
 <li> During the demonstration, highlight important aspects, such as
 user interface design, what is going on at the application's
 back-end, etc. </li>
 </ol></li>
</ol>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><b>Most important:</b></FONT> Do <em>not</em>
only show what the user could do <em>manually</em> with your system;
show also what the system can do <em>automatically</em> -- what are
the "<em>smarts</em>" of your system that are worth noticing?  What
kind of <em>automatic data processing</em> your system does? <BR>
Remember, nobody is impressed with a system where the user has to
invest hard work to get even simple tasks accomplished.  <em>Make
every effort to reduce the number of clicks and keystrokes necessary
for task completion.</em>

<p>The most important thing for the demo is that <b>you want to
impress the audience with your <u>technical achievement</u> for this
semester</b>.  You want to impress the audience that:
<ul>
<li> You are addressing an <em>important problem</em> </li>
<li> The problem presents <em>technical challenges</em>, which you have
successfully tackled </li>
<li> Your solution employes <em>sophisticated software engineering
techniques</em> </li>
<li> This product is easy to understand and operate/use </li>
<li> This product is reliable and professionaly developed </li>
</ul>

<H3>3. &nbsp; Demo Schedule</H3>

<P><b>Final Demo Room is at D110, Engineering Building D-Wing.</b> <br>
Please contact the TAs by email ASAP requesting a time slot for
you to give the demo. When contacting the TAs, put the request title
in the subject line so that they can speed up the work.  <BR>

<A
HREF="http://www.caip.rutgers.edu/~parlak/Teaching.html">
This table shows the current demo reservation schedule.</A>

<P> The demo should last <b>no more than 18 minutes</b>.  Make sure
your demo is ready <b>before it starts</b>; as you can see, the
schedule is tight and I'll not be able to wait until you get ready.
See the TA before the demo if you need to install and try it. </P>

<P> NOTE: It is <b>required</b> that all group members be present
for the demo and each member takes part. Demo presentations are open
and anybody interested is free to attend. However, you are not
required to attend other groups' demos. <BR><BR>

<H3>4. &nbsp; Grading</H3>

<P>Make sure to email us the  <A
HREF="projects.html#CONTRIB">breakdown of individual contributions</A>
immediately after the demo.

<P>See also the <A HREF="projects.html#GRADING">grading policy</A> for
the assigning the overall team grade vs. grades for the individual
members.

<P> The demo will be graded as follows:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF"><TD><CENTER>Aspect</CENTER></TD> <TD>Points</TD>
<TD><CENTER>Explanation</CENTER></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Functionality / <br> Task complexity</TD><TD> 15 </TD>
<TD>
Emphasize the key functions of your system, what are they useful for. <br>
Show that this is a <em>non-trivial project</em> that required a team
of smart <br> students working for a full semester.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Programming, <b>not</b> <br> webpage design</TD><TD> 15 </TD>
<TD>
You must convince us that <em>programming</em> has been
<em>central</em> for your <br> project development and webpage design
has only been <em>ancillary</em>.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Software<br> reliability</TD><TD> 10 </TD>
<TD>
"Software reliability" means that your software runs without
crashing <br> and, generally, it does not display unintended behavior or
bugs.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Presentation<br> quality</TD><TD> 10 </TD>
<TD>
Impress the audience that you have developed a useful, non-trivial
product, <br> that only a highly trained software engineer can do.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>User Interface / <br> Ease of use</TD><TD> 10 </TD>
<TD>
"Ease-of-use of the user interface" should not be confused
with a flashy <br> interface.  On the contrary, you should avoid flashy
user interfaces.  <br> "Ease-of-use" means that interface is easy to
understand and operate.  <br> A minimal user interface that is well
organized should be sufficient.
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Novelty/ <br> Usefulness</TD><TD> 10 </TD>
<TD>
Demonstrate that you have invented at least something, some part <br> of
your product, rather than plainly copying an existing idea. <br>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>Product <br> brochure</TD><TD> 5 </TD>
<TD>
Informativeness and general appearance of the product brochure.
</TR>

</TABLE>

<P>NOTE: Please keep in mind that the grades are assigned
<em>competitively</em>, i.e., the group that is perceived as the best
receives 100 % and the others are scaled relatively to this.

<B> Report #2: SYSTEM DESIGN -- Iteration 1(b) --&nbsp; (<A
HREF="syllabus.html#DELIVERABLES">due date given here</A>)</B>
<HR>


<P> <b>Note</b>: Keep this report for future reference since it will
be part of the final report (<A HREF="report3.html">Report #3</A>).
Thus, as you progress through the semester, take every opportunity to
revise, update and/or correct it.</P>

<H3>1. &nbsp; Report Format</H3>

<P> The report must contain the following sections and sub-sections.
Each section/subsection should be clearly delineated with a proper
heading.

<ol>
<li> Cover Page and Individual Contributions Breakdown, as specified <A
HREF="projects.html#REPORTS"><b>here</b></A>.<BR> <FONT SIZE=-1>The
contributions breakdown must contain the <em>responsibility
matrix</em> and <em>responsibility allocation chart</em> as described
in <a href="report1.html#EFFORT">Report #1</a></FONT></li>
<li>Table of Contents<BR> <FONT SIZE=-1>Make sure that the page
numbers listed here are correct</FONT></li>
<li> Interaction Diagrams
 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <ul>
 <li> Do interaction diagrams for the use cases you elaborated (fully
 described) in <A HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A> </li> <li> Mention
 explicitly what design principles you employ in the process of
 assigning responsibilities to objects.  This can be done either as
 comment &#147;bubbles&#148; in the diagram, or in the caption of the
 diagram. <BR> Read the <a href="index.html#TEXTBOOK">UML textbook</a>
 about interaction diagrams and Section 2.4.1 in the <A
 HREF="../../books/SE/"><b>course lecture notes</b></A>, in order to
 learn about good design principles </li>
 </ul></FONT>
<li> Class Diagram and Interface Specification
 <ol type="a">
 <li> Class Diagram<br> <FONT SIZE=-1>
   Show all classes and their associations.  Only indicate
   visibilities of attributes and operations; full details about the
   types and signatures should be provided in the next item.<BR>
   If you cannot fit the class diagram on one page, or it looks too
   cluttered, I suggest you create one overall class diagram showing
   all classes and their relationships, but don't show any class
   details (attributes and operations).
   Then you show all the details as part of the next item.</FONT></li>
 <li> Data Types and Operation Signatures<br> <FONT SIZE=-1>
   Independently of the class diagram, write down class specification
   in UML notation. For every class, specify data types of all
   attributes and operation signatures</FONT></li>
 </ol> </li>
<li>System Architecture and System Design
 <ol type="a">
 <li> Architectural Styles <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>Describe the
     <a
     href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture#Examples_of_Architectural_Styles_.2F_Patterns">architectural styles</a> used in your design &nbsp; (Google search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=software+architectural+styles+example&aq=0&oq=software+Architectural+Styles">software architectural styles example</a>) </FONT> </li>
 <li> Identifying Subsystems <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>Draw and describe
     <b>UML package diagram</b> of subsystems in your system (See
     the <a href="index.html#TEXTBOOK">UML textbook</a>)</FONT>
     </li>
 <li> Mapping Subsystems to Hardware <br> <FONT
     SIZE=-1>Does you system need to run on multiple computers?  For
     example, you may have client (web browser) and 
     server (web server) processes, running on different machines.
      <BR>  If NO, skip to the next item; <BR>
     If YES, what modules run on which machine?
     E.g., if you use handheld computers, what
     runs on the handheld and what runs on a base station?)
     </FONT> </li>
 <li> Persistent Data Storage <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>Does your system need
     to save data that need to outlive a single execution of the
     system? <BR>
     If NO, skip to the next item; <BR>
     If YES, identify the persistent objects and select the storage
     management strategy, e.g., flat files, relational database, etc. <br>
     Attach the description of the file format and/or database
     <b>database schema</b> (format of database tables)</FONT> </li>
 <li> Network Protocol <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>
     If your runs on a single machine, this question probably does
     NOT apply;  skip to the next item; <BR>
     Otherwise, which communication protocol do you use,
     e.g., plain Java sockets, Java RMI, Java JDBC, HTTP, etc.
     Explain why you made your specific choice. <br>
     If you are using plain sockets, attach the description of the
     communication protocol (types of messages, message format,
     etc.). </FONT> </li>
 <li> Global Control Flow <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>
  <ul>
  <li> <em>Execution orderness</em>: Is your system
     <em>procedure-driven</em> and executes in a "linear" fashion,
     where every user every time has to go through the same steps, or
     is it an <em>event-driven</em> system that waits in a loop for
     events, and every user can generate the actions in a different order?
  <li> <em>Time dependency</em>: Is there any timers in your system? <br>
     Is your system of event-response type, with no concern for real
     time, or is it a real-time system?  If it's real-time, is it
     periodic, and what are the time constraints for each
     period? </li>
 <li> <em>Concurrency</em>: Does your system use multiple
     threads? <BR>  If NO, skip to the next item; <BR>
     If YES, identify the objects that have separate threads of
     control and describe any synchronization between the
     threads? </li>
  </ul> </FONT>
<li> Hardware Requirements <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>What system does
     resources your system depend upon?  Examples are, screen
     display, disk storage, communication network, or you may be
     accessing some special sensor/instrument. <br>
     Describe exact requirements for these resources in order
     for your system to run.  For example, you need color display,
     with minimum resolution of 640 &#215; 480 pixels; minimum of 2
     Gbytes hard disk space; minimum network bandwidth 56
     Kbps. </FONT> </li>
 </ol>
</li>
<li> Algorithms and Data Structures
<ol type="a">
 <li> Algorithms <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>Does your system use any
     complex algorithms?  For example, when computing a motion
     trajectory for an animate figure in a game, you may use some
     numerical or computer-graphics algorithms.  Or, when assessing
     stock market movements, you may be using statistical
     algorithms. <BR>  If NO, skip to the next item; <BR>
     If YES, describe your algorithms.  For example, for the animate
     figure example above, will the path coordinates be precomputed
     and stored in a look-up table or will they be computed using a
     spline interpolation algorithm. <br>
     It's a good idea to use <em>activity diagrams</em> to describe
     the algorithm design.</FONT> </li>
<li> Data Structures <br> <FONT SIZE=-1>Does your system use any
     complex data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, hash
     tables, or trees? <BR>  If NO, skip to the next item; <BR>
     If YES, what criteria you used in deciding what data
     structure to use, e.g., performance vs. flexibility?</FONT> </li>
 </ol>
</li>
<li> User Interface Design and Implementation<FONT SIZE=-1>
 <ul>
 <li> Describe whether and how you modified and <em>implemented</em>
      the initial screen mock-ups developed for <A
      HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A>. Comment only on significant
      changes in your user interface, those that reduce (or increase)
      the <A HREF="report1-appA.html">user effort</A>. Changes of
      colors or styles are less important and should be omittted from
      your report.</li>
 <li> The textbook does not deal much with the GUI design.
      Excellent guidelines for GUI design can be found here: <br>
      Sun Microsystems, Inc. <i>Java Look and Feel Design
      Guidelines</i>. Mountain View, CA, 1999. Available at: <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/">http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/ed2/book/</a> </li>
 <li> "Ease-of-use" is generally considered the key characteristic
      of user interface. "Ease-of-use" should not be confused with a
      flashy interface, with lots of colors, picture, graphics,
      etc. On the contrary, you should avoid flashy user
      interfaces. "Ease-of-use" means that interface is intuitive,
      easy to understand and operate, without having to ask many
      questions or read voluminous documentation. A minimal user
      interface that is well organized should be sufficient.  You
      already considered the user effort as part of <A
      HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A>, and here you should strive
      to minimize the user effort, thus maximizing the
      "ease-of-use".</li>
 </ul></FONT> </li>
<li> Progress Report and Plan of Work
 <ol type="a">
 <li> Progress Report<BR> <FONT SIZE=-1>What use cases have been
 implemented? <BR> 
 What is already functional, what is currently being tackled?
 </FONT></li>
<li> Plan of Work<BR> <FONT SIZE=-1>List the projected milestones and
 dates by which you plan to accomplish them.  Preferably, you should
 use <a href="http://www.ganttchart.com/">Gantt charts</a> for
 planning and scheduling your project.</FONT>
</li>
<li> Breakdown of Responsibilities<FONT SIZE=-1>
 <ul>
 <li> List the names of modules and classes that each team member is
 currently responsible for developing, coding, and testing </li>
 <li> Who will coordiante the integration? </li>
 <li> Who will perform the testing of the integrated system? </li>
 </ul> </FONT></li>
</ol> </li>
<li> References<BR> <FONT SIZE=-1>The list of references should
contain exact <em>references and URLs</em> of any material that is
used in the project and doesn't come from the textbook.</FONT> </li>
</ol>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> No matter what programming language (Java or something
else) you use to implement your software, <em>you must provide design
diagrams (interaction diagrams) in UML</em>. Those diagrams <b>must
correspond</b> with the implemenation source code, and this will be
checked when with <A HREF="report3.html">Report #3</A> you submit the
source code, too. This means that the class, method, and variable
names should be the same in the code and in the UML diagrams. Also,
the methods n the source code must be called in the order indicated in
the UML diagrams. See Chapter 2 in the textbook and Miles & Hamilton:
<em>Learning UML 2.0</em> for the how to create interaction diagrams.
<BR> Source code should <em>not</em> be submitted with this report.

<P><B>NOTE:</B> <em>Comment your diagrams!</em> Describe all design
decisions and other things that are not obvious from the diagrams.
Any useful information is welcome.  There is no limit on the number of
pages for the report.  Having good comments and explanations greatly
helps in reading and evaluating the project and will positively
contribute to your grade.</P>

<P><em>Updating Use Cases From Report#1</em>. The use case diagrams
would presumably remain the same from the previous report on object
oriented-analysis (<A HREF="report1.html">Report #1</A>), at least for
now, so no need to repeat any material from that report.  If any
changes are made, these should be documented in <A
HREF="report3.html">Report #3</A>.</P>

<P><em>Drawing Interaction Diagrams</em>. Theoretically, a single
interaction diagram should be drawn for each system function (check
your system sequence diagram - SSD).  Since some system functions are
trivial, I suggest the following practical technique.  Start drawing
one interaction diagram <em>per use case</em>.  If, at some point, the
diagram overflows to the next page, <em>split your interaction
diagram</em> and draw one diagram <em>per system function</em>.</P>

<P> <em>Applying Design Principles</em>.It is very critical to pay
attention to the proper use of the design principles covered in
Section 2.4 of <A HREF="../../books/SE/">class
lecture notes</A>.  (Quick refresher: design principles include:
<em>Expert Doer</em>, <em>High Cohesion</em>, <em>Low Coupling</em>.)
Proper <em>responsibility assignment</em>, separation of
<em>application logic</em> from <em>presentation</em> and
<em>storage</em> tiers is of the utmost importance and will be given a
great weight in grading the reports.  <em>It is important to document
the alternative solutions that were considered in the design process,
identify all the tradeoffs encountered and explain why the
alternatives were abandoned.</em></P>

<P>This report is the final "blueprint" before the construction phase
comences.  Given your report, anyone who knows how to read UML
diagrams should be able to implement the product in a straightforward
manner.  This means that you need to clearly specify all details about
the algorithms and data structures used, as well as about the target
runtime environment.  This is by no means an exhaustive list!  Please
include any other information that you feel the implementer may find
useful.</P>

<H3>2. &nbsp; Report Preparation</H3>

<P> The guidelines remain the same as for <a
href="report1.html#PREPARATION">Report #1</a>.</P>


<H3>3. &nbsp; Grading</H3>
